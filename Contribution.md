# Akashic Records: Contribution Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you contribute to the Akashic Records project.

## About the Project

Akashic Records is a mobile application designed to organize and present meaningful data, drawing inspiration from the concept of Akashic Records as a repository of universal knowledge. The app offers offline access to data, features from various web sources, and tools to personalize the reading experience.

## How to Contribute

We appreciate your contributions! There are several ways you can contribute to the Akashic Records project:

*   **Report Bugs:** If you find a bug, please report it by creating a new "Issue" in the project's GitHub repository. Include a clear description of the bug, how to reproduce it, and, if possible, a solution or suggestion.

*   **Suggest Improvements:** If you have ideas to improve the application, create an "Issue" detailing your suggestion. This may include new features, design improvements, performance optimizations, or other suggestions for improvement.

*   **Develop New Features:** If you are a developer and want to contribute code, follow these steps:

    1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the official repository on GitHub.
    2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your fork for your feature or bug fix. Name the branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-search`, `fix/login-bug`).
    3.  **Implement Your Changes:** Make the necessary code changes in your branch.
    4.  **Test Your Code:** Make sure your code works as expected and doesn't break existing functionality. Run unit and integration tests, if applicable.
    5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages, explaining the changes you made.
    6.  **Create a Pull Request:** Create a Pull Request (PR) on the official project repository from your branch in your fork.
    7.  **Describe Your PR:** In the Pull Request, include a detailed description of your changes, the reason behind them, and how to test them. If the PR resolves an "Issue", mention it in the description (e.g., "Resolves #123").
    8.  **Participate in Review:** Wait for your Pull Request to be reviewed. Project team members may request changes or provide feedback. Respond to comments and make the necessary modifications.
    9.  **Merge Your PR:** After approval, your Pull Request will be merged into the main repository.

*   **Documentation:** Contribute to the project's documentation. This includes improving this contribution guide, documenting the code, creating tutorials, etc.

*   **Translations:** Help translate the application into different languages.

## Development Guide

**Prerequisites:**

*   [ ] Flutter SDK installed and configured.
*   [ ] A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio).
*   [ ] Basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter.
*   [ ] Familiarity with Git version control and GitHub.

**Project Structure:**

The project follows a typical directory structure for Flutter projects:

*   `lib/`: Contains the application source code.
    *   `lib/src/`: Contains the application source code (recommended to separate by functionality).
        *   `lib/src/screens/`: Application screens.
        *   `lib/src/widgets/`: Custom widgets.
        *   `lib/src/models/`: Data model classes.
        *   `lib/src/services/`: Business logic (APIs, data manipulation).
        *   `lib/src/utils/`: Utilities and helper functions.
    *   `lib/main.dart`: Application entry point.
*   `android/`: Native Android code.
*   `ios/`: Native iOS code.
*   `test/`: Unit tests.
*   `pubspec.yaml`: Flutter project configuration file (dependencies, etc.).

**Code Style:**

*   Follow Dart and Flutter code conventions.
*   Use your code editor's automatic code formatting (e.g., "Format Document" in VS Code).
*   Write clear and concise comments in your code.

**State Management:**

The project uses the `Provider` package for state management. Make sure you understand how `Provider` works before contributing code that involves state management.

**Testing:**

Write unit and integration tests for your code. This ensures that your changes don't introduce bugs and that the application continues to function correctly.
